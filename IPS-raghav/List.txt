List of experiments

1. alpha values
2. Different potential functions
3. Initial value experiment 

different maturity times

1. N = 1 , solve PDE to get exact distribution and compare answers with IPS
2. No stochastic volatility, N=1 , implement Goodman's solution
3. check convergence rate to MC p's


Unlikely suggestions
1. Sensitivity Analysis



Plots------------

MC distribution with - multiple values of M - t=1,2,3,4,5
log plot of the above 

MC and IPS comparison for all T's

for IPS distribution vary - M , alpha

no stochastic volatility - find exact solution, comapare with M
with stochastic volatility - find PDE solution for the pdf, and compare

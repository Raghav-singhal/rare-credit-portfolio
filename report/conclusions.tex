In the two models of credit defaults that we applied the IPS algorithm to,  we
see the effectiveness of the IPS algorithm in sampling rare events. As seen
clearly in our results the selection steps select paths which lead to more
samples of the rare event. Using these resampled paths we are able to compute
an estimate of the probability of rare events as described in Section
\ref{subsubsec:theory_IPS_MC}.

Also as indicated in \cite{CarmonaIPS} as well as Section
\ref{subsubsec:merton_discretization}, we evolve similar to the underlying 
process. This makes the implementation and understanding of the model easier.

Thus we believe that IPS technique is quite useful in sampling rare events in 
very high dimensional problems.
